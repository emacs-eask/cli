Eask is heavily inspired by Cask, so they are somewhat related! This tool focuses
on consistency! [Cask]() and [makem.sh]() both rely on bash which Windows doesn't
run on by default. If you use WSL or other environment system file Cygwin/MSYS
; then this may not be the tool you are looking for! 👀

## 📰 News

* `0.4.0` - Add color logger
* `0.3.0` - Add verbosity level and timestamps
* `0.2.0` - Done basic error handling with exit code at the end of executions
* `0.1.39` - Use `spawn` instead `exec`; now messages will be printed immediately
* `0.1.0` - Project barebones are pretty much complete!

## 📝 About Eask file

`Eask` is the magic file that `eask` will read it as the init file in Emacs.
The syntaxes are very similar to the `Cask` file, but different.

```el
(source "gnu")

(package "your-package" "1.0.0" "Your package description")

(package-file "your-package-file.el")
```

Remember, `Eask` is just the regular elisp file, and should be read it from
the Emacs itself!

```el
; Regular Eask file content...

(setq byte-compile-error-on-warn t)  ; Singal error if warning occurred
```

`eask` provides some hooks so you can define your own action before/after
each command. The name of the hook follows the rule of
`eask-{before/after}-command-{%name%}-hook`.

For example, to enable compile on warn on `byte-compile` command

```el
(add-hook 'eask-before-command-compile-hook 
          (lambda () (setq byte-compile-error-on-warn t)))
```

## 📂 State of the project

The project barebones are pretty much done, we are currently looking for
contirbutors to give us feedback and improve our TUI/UX for this tool!

We are also looking for advices to add more Emacser often use commands and
options, so these features are prepared by default! Like command `lint` 
(package-lint) or option `--debug` refers to `debug-on-error` to `t`!

## 🏆 Goals for the project

1. Consistent sandbox testing across all systems
2. Has most commands that Emacsers often used (byte-compile, checkdoc, etc)
3. No dependencies installed by default; only install packages when it's needed!
4. Extra: Package Management Tool for your personal configuration/package

## 📂 Project Structure

The project structure are very simple, all we need is to look into 3 places.

1. `eask` file at the root of the project
2. `cmds` folder with all available commands
3. `lisp` folder with all elisp code
  - `lisp/extern` is the external modules/packages we used

`eask` is the node entry, and the main yargs definition! `cmds` and `lisp`
folders are command files that correspond to each other.

The sandbox logic is stored inside file `./lisp/_prepare.el`.

### 📌 Dependencies

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [yargs](https://github.com/yargs/yargs) to parse commands and options.
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) of course; make sure this is inside your environment PATH!
