This document guides you through the installation of Eask.

Install Eask on macOS, Linux, Windows, BSD, and on any machine that can run the [Node.js][].

{{< toc >}}

## 💾 Prebuilt binaries

Download the appropriate version for your platform from [Eask Releases](https://github.com/emacs-eask/cli/releases).
Once downloaded, the binary can be run from anywhere. You don’t need to install
it in a global location. This works well for shared hosts and other systems
where you don’t have a privileged account.

Ideally, you should install it somewhere in your `PATH` for easy use. `/usr/local/bin`
is the most probable location.

## 💾 Using Shell

On macOS or Linux:

```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emacs-eask/cli/master/webinstall/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows:

```sh
$ curl.exe -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emacs-eask/cli/master/webinstall/install.bat | cmd /Q
```

$ cd eask-cli

# install the requirements
$ npm install
```

### 🏡 Setup (through script)

You can now run `eask` using the script `bin/eask`; add `/path/to/eask-cli/bin/`
to your environment `PATH` to execute eask from any location!

On Linux/macOS,

```sh
export PATH="path/to/eask/bin:$PATH"
```

On Windows,

```batch
set PATH=%PATH%;c:/path/to/eask/bin
```

Once you have set it up correctly, try `eask --version` then you should see
the current `eask`'s version number! 🎉 🎊

### 🏡 Setup (through executable)

To run `eask` through executable, you will need [pkg][] installed on your machine.

```sh
# install it locally in the workspace scope
$ npm install --dev

# or

# install it globally
$ npm install -g pkg
```

Subsequently, run the following command to build the executable.
By default, it will generate an executable in the `dist` folder.

```sh
# build from sources. For available targets see `scripts` in `package.json`
$ npm run pkg-linux-x64

# move `lisp` to `dist` folder
mv lisp dist
```

You can now run `eask` using the executable `dist/eask`; add `/path/to/eask-cli/dist/`
to your environment `PATH` to execute eask from any location! 🎉 🎊
