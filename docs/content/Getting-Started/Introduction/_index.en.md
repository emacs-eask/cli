Eask was originally designed as a package development tool for Elisp projects.
However, it has since expanded to support a wide range of Emacs Lisp tasks.
It can now be used in three major ways:

1. As a development tool for Elisp packages.
2. For managing dependencies in your Emacs configuration.
3. To run Elisp programs for a variety of purposes (essentially functioning as a runtime).

With these capabilities in mind, what sets Eask apart from other build tools
like [Cask][], [makem.sh][], and [Eldev][]?

Great question! Eask has evolved beyond just a build tool—it serves multiple purposes! Here’s what Eask aims to be:

- **Consistent**: Provides a reliable sandboxing environment across all systems.
- **Versatile**: Includes commonly used Emacs commands like `byte-compilation`, `checkdoc`, and more.
- **Robust**: Delivers useful results even when user errors occur.
- **Lightweight**: Runs on any platform without dependencies.

*📝 P.S. See [Why Eask?](https://emacs-eask.github.io/Getting-Started/Introduction/#-why-eask) for more detailed
information.*

## ❓ Why Eask?

`Eask` follows the same philosophy as [Cask][]. To understand why you should use
`Eask` (or [Cask][]), check out the [Why Cask?](https://cask.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/introduction.html#introduction-why-cask)
section on their website.

Many tools, such as [Cask][], [makem.sh][], and [Eldev][], don’t fully support Windows.
`Cask` has dropped support for Legacy Windows, `makem.sh` relies on Bash, and while
`Eldev` does support Windows, its author doesn’t actively use it on the platform,
meaning it lacks full testing (as seen in their CI workflows). In contrast, `Eask`
is designed to work across all major platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows
It prioritizes cross-platform compatibility and ensures consistency across different
operating systems. If `Eask` runs on your machine, it will work reliably on any platform.

Here’s our recommendation: if you’re developing an OS-specific package that will never
need cross-platform support, other tools may be a better fit. However, if you want a
tool that ensures seamless consistency across different operating systems, Eask is an excellent choice.

Another major advantage of `Eask` is its transparency—there are no hidden workflows
or obscure processes running in the background. Additionally, `Eask` strictly
avoids hacks or workaround fixes, ensuring that solutions are clean, maintainable,
and aligned with best practices.

### 🔍 Feature Wise

This is the feature comparison between each tool. Every tool has its advantages;
choose the right tool that works for you!

If the features are not listed below, either it is forgotten or simply
considered too essential, so every tool has it; hence we don't add them to the
