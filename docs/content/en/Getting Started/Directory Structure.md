Running the **`eask create package`** generator from the command-line will create
a directory with the following structure:

```
.
├── .gitignore
├── Makefile
├── Eask
├── README.md
└── {package-file}.el
```

## Directory Structure Explained

The following is a high-level overview of each of the files.

`.gitignore`

Gitignore file, to ignore files you don't like to include from your repository.
By default, it already excludes `files` and `directories` that are generated by
Eask.

`Makefile`

Makefile that has already included basic tests for your package. It now has
the following tasks be default:

* Test build (packaging + installing)
* Test byte-compile
* Test checkdoc (style checker)
* Test lint (package linter)

`README.md`

The generated document file. This is used to display the main page
from your repository.

`{package-file}.el`

This is the main package file; where you should write your elisp code.
If you attempt to create a multiple-file package; you would need to
edit the `Eask`-file accordingly.
