Running the **`eask create package`** generator from the command-line will create
a directory with the following structure:

```
.
├── .github/workflows/test.yml
├── .gitignore
├── Makefile
├── Eask
├── README.md
└── {package-file}.el
```

## Directory Structure Explained

The following is a high-level overview of each of the files.

`.github/workflows/test.yml`

GitHub actions workflow file that is read by GitHub Actions. This file has
setups the basic environment for you to test your elisp project. Like, such
as installing Emacs, setup Eask, etc.

`.gitignore`

Gitignore file, to ignore files you don't like to include from your repository.
By default, it already excludes `files` and `directories` that are generated by
Eask.

`Makefile`

Makefile that has already included basic tests for your package. It now has
the following tasks be default:

* Test build (packaging + installing)
* Test byte-compile
* Test checkdoc (style checker)
* Test lint (package linter)

`README.md`

The generated document file. This is used to display the main page
from your repository.

`{package-file}.el`

This is the main package file; where you should write your elisp code.
If you attempt to create a multiple-file packages; you would need to
edit the `Eask`-file accordingly.
