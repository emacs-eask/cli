## 💾 Quick Install

### Binary (Cross-platform)

Download the appropriate version for your platform from [Eask Releases](https://github.com/emacs-eask/eask/releases).
Once downloaded, the binary can be run from anywhere. You don’t need to install
it into a global location. This works well for shared hosts and other systems
where you don’t have a privileged account.

Ideally, you should install it somewhere in your `PATH` for easy use. `/usr/local/bin`
is the most probable location.

### npm

If you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine, you can
install Eask with the following one-liner:

```sh
$ npm install -g @emacs-eask/cli
```
