Easkâ€™s CLI is fully featured but simple to use, even for those who have very
limited experience working from the command line.

The following is a description of the most common commands you will use while
developing your Eask project. See the [Commands and options](https://emacs-eask.github.io/Getting-Started/Commands-and-options/)
for a comprehensive view of Easkâ€™s CLI.

Once you have installed [Eask](), make sure it is in your `PATH`. You can test
that Eask has been installed correctly via the help command:

```
$ eask help
```

The output you see in your console should be similar to the following:

```
eask is the main command, used to manage your Emacs dependencies

Eask is a command-line tool that helps you build, lint, and test Emacs Lisp packages.
