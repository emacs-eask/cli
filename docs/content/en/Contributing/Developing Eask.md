### 🚩 Prerequisites

To make changes to Eask, you should have:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) the development environment.
2. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for the package manager.
3. [yargs](https://github.com/yargs/yargs) for parsing the command-line.
4. [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), 26.1 or above!

### 📝 Building

To build the development environment, you would have to install Eask using
the [manual installation](https://emacs-eask.github.io/eask/installation#-manual-installation)
method. (Not install through NPM) Make sure you have setup the environment
PATH variable, so you can call `eask` from the terminal.

After you have step through the installation, try:

```sh
$ eask locate
```

It should print out the location of your working Eask workspace. You
should be able to identify the Eask workspace, even you have multiple
Eask version installed!

### 📈 Testing

Eask does not offer local testing, all our tests are accomplished using GitHub
Actions. Please fork our repository, and push your changes to your fork. GitHub
Actions should pick up the test for you!

Make sure you have GitHub Actions enabled in your repository (forked). Got to
**Settings** -> **Actions** -> **General** -> **Actions Permissions**; make sure
you have checked the correct options.
