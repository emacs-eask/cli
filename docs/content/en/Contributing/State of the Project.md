The project's bare-bones are pretty much done, we are currently looking for
contributors to give us feedback and improve our TUI/UX for this tool!

We are also looking for advice to add more. Emacser often use commands
and options, so these features are prepared by default! Like command
`lint` (package-lint) or option `--debug` refers to `debug-on-error`
to `t`!
