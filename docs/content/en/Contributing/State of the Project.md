The project's barebones are pretty much done, we are currently looking for
contributors to give us feedback and improve our TUI/UX for this tool!

We are also looking for advice to add more Emacser often use commands and
options, so these features are prepared by default! Like command `lint` 
(package-lint) or option `--debug` refers to `debug-on-error` to `t`!
