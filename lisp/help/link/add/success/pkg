  - [ ] (Required) `SOURCE-autoloads.el`                      Prepare autoloads
  - [ ] (Required) `SOURCE-pkg.el`                            Prepare -pkg file
  - [ ] (Optional) Compile source package with `.elc` files

If the source package uses Eask, you can use `eask` commands to accomplish these tasks.

  - `eask generate autoloads`
  - `eask generate pkg-file`
  - `eask compile`
