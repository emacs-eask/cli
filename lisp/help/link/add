âœ“ You have now created the link, here are things you might want to consider:
  
  - [ ] `SOURCE-pkg.el` file                                  Package descriptor
  - [ ] (Optional) `SOURCE-autoloads.el`                      Package autoloads
  - [ ] (Optional) Compile source package with `.elc` files   Use `.elc` may be metter choice

If the source package uses Eask, you can use `eask` commands to accomplish these tasks.
   
  * `eask pkg-file`
  * `eask autoloads`
  * `eask compile`
